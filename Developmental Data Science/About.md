# Developmental Data Science  
### Sponsored by  
[DevoWorm Group](https://devoworm.weebly.com/) and [OpenWorm Foundation](http://openworm.org/). 

### Instructors  
Dr. Bradly Alicea [web](https://bradly-alicea.weebly.com/), TBA

### Contributors
Asmit Singh [web](https://asmitks.github.io/)  
Mayukh Deb [web](https://mayukhdeb.github.io/)

### Course Duration  
This course is self-paced, but overall should involve around 20-30 hours of engagement (about 40% in-class time for a 3-credit University course).  

### Discussion Board
Link to the [discussion board](https://eliademy.com/app/a/courses/bdb7b0a934/discussions). Here you will discuss assignments, presentations, and readings.

### Post Conditions and Takeaways
1) An understanding of how developmental biology can be approached using the tools and principles of data science.  

2) A crash-course in developmental biology.  

3) The ability to make a substantial contribution to the OpenWorm/DevoWorm community.  

### Overview 
This course is intended to provide collaborators and students with basic background in how to conduct data science research with particular relevance to the area of developmental biology. It also approaches developmental biology from a data scientific perspective, highlighting ways to analyze data extracted from developmental processes. Taken together with the other short courses, tutorials, and micro credentials in the OW/DW curriculum, this course should offer new OW/DW contributors and interested learners in the global community an indispensable educational resource.

### Evaluation  
Each section will have assignments, which the learner will complete to earn each part of the course. Assignments will be pushed to an appropriate folder in the [Push Assignments Here](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/tree/master/Developmental%20Data%20Science/Push%20Assignments%20Here) subdirectory.

* **Assignments**
1) enroll for and earn both Literature Mining badges [1](https://www.badgelist.com/Orthogonal-Research/Literature-Mining-I-working-with-papers),[2](https://www.badgelist.com/Orthogonal-Research/Literature-Mining-II-working-with-secondary-data) on Badgelist (Instructors will award).   

2) using [these tabular data](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/blob/master/Data%20Repo/sampledata.csv), reformat into either XML or JSON format and submit a pull request to [this repo](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/tree/master/Data%20Repo) consisting of a file labeled FirstName_LastName.format


### 1) Data Types   
* **Point data:** a single object or event. **Example:** a cell centroid.

* **Processes:** multiple units of point data that are linked through a set of causal relationships. **Example:** growth of a cell cluster.

* **Comparative:** analogies between multiple processes. **Example:** growth in a slime mold versus growth in a bacterial colony.

* **Longitudinal:** point data, processes, or comparisons that occur over time. **Example:** different phases of growth, from early to late in the process.

* **Assignments**
1) Download [this Slideshow]() about each data type and describe one example of each of the four datatypes listed above. Submit a pull request to [this repo](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/tree/master/Developmental%20Data%20Science/Push%20Assignments%20Here/Data%20Types) consisting of a file labeled FirstName_LastName.format


### 2) From Cells to Pixels  
* **Image segmentation:** read the [Wikipedia stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) on this topic.

  * segment [this image](https://github.com/devoworm/Drosophila-imaginal-disc-segmentation/blob/master/Wolff-Gordon-Gordon-drawing.TIF) of the _Drosophila_ third instar eye imaginal disc using [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) or [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

* **Feature selection:** read the [Wikipedia stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) on this topic.

  * review the [feature selection examples here](https://github.com/devoworm/Drosophila-imaginal-disc-segmentation/tree/master/Areal%20Size%20Distributions), and using the image [presented in step a](https://github.com/devoworm/Drosophila-imaginal-disc-segmentation/blob/master/Wolff-Gordon-Gordon-drawing.TIF), run your own feature selection analysis using [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) or [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

* **Categorization and annotation:** read these Wikipedia stubs ([categorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization), [annotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation)) on the topics.

  * review these data tables ([1](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/blob/master/Data%20Repo/cellsbyfamily.csv), [2](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/blob/master/Data%20Repo/alladultcellsinembryo.csv)) and produce two plots: one showing the number of neurons present at different time periods, and the other showing changes in the number of cells present by cell family over time.

* **Assignments**
1) download and read the paper "[Morphogenetic processes as data: Quantitative structure in the Drosophila eye imaginal disc](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/395640v1)".

2) identify each analysis in the accompanying [open data repo](https://github.com/devoworm/Drosophila-imaginal-disc-segmentation)

3) review the activities for this section and push images representing "image segmentation", "feature selection", and "categorization and annotation" to the [Push Assignments Here repo](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/tree/master/Developmental%20Data%20Science/Push%20Assignments%20Here) for this section.


### 3) Data Structures    
* **Cell lineage trees:** developmental process represented by a binary tree, where a single mother cell divides into two daughter cells. 

  * cell lineage trees are often ordered by anatomical orientation (daughter cells located anterior to its sister branch to the left, while daughter cells located posteriorly to its sister branches to the right).  

  * cell lineage trees are often defined by a nomenclature, which can be used as a source of data.
  
  * Visualisation: [Lineage Tree](http://wormweb.org/celllineage#c=P0&z=1) 

* **Embryo networks:** unordered graphical relationships between individual cells in an embryo. Each node is the connections within the network are based on relative distances within the embryo.  

  * see [this working document](https://github.com/devoworm/Theoretical-Types-of-Embryo-Developmental-Networks) for more information on how embryo networks connect to actual developmental processes.  

* **Time series:** longitudinal data represented by a [discrete variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable#Discrete_variable) composed of datapoints dependent with respect to time. Read this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) stub for more information.  

* **Assignments**
