## Overview | Course
This course is intended to provide collaborators and students with an essential background in how to understand and critically evaluate models and representation for a host of systems. We will draw from Biological, Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Life systems to decipher the types of models used in OpenWorm and DevoWorm. 

### Evaluation  
Each section will have assignments, which the learner will complete to earn each part of the course. Assignments will be pushed to an appropriate folder in the [Push Assignments Here](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/tree/master/Models%20and%20Representations/Push%20Assignments%20Here) subdirectory.

## OpenWorm/DevoWorm Models and Representations  

You will be introduced to the diversity of model types that make up "digital worm" by earning [microcredentials (digital badges)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_badge) geared towards practical interactions with several model types.

1. Model of Action Potentials:  

* [Hodgkin-Huxley Tutorial](https://www.badgelist.com/OpenWorm/Hodgkin-Huxley-Tutorial-Graduate)

2. Muscle Structure and Function (series of three badges): 

* [Muscle Model Builder](https://www.badgelist.com/OpenWorm/Muscle-Model-Builder)

* [Muscle Model Explorer](https://www.badgelist.com/OpenWorm/Muscle-Model-Explorer)

* [Muscle Model Hacker](https://www.badgelist.com/OpenWorm/Muscle-Model-Hacker)

3. Multiple Simulations in a Box:

* [Simulation Stack (Virtual Machine)](https://www.badgelist.com/OpenWorm/OpenWorm-Docker-Apprentice)

**Assignments**
1) You will be awarded one certificate per digital badge. Submit a pull request to [this repo](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/tree/master/Models%20and%20Representations/Push%20Assignments%20Here) consisting of a subdirectory labeled FirstName_LastName and include all earned certificates within.

2) Explore [NeuronUnit](https://github.com/scidash/neuronunit/blob/dev/README.md), which is a combination of instantiating scientific models of neurons and regular [model checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking). Your assignment is to become familiar with the software and work through the tutorial provided [at this link](https://github.com/scidash/neuronunit/blob/dev/README.md).  

* Complete part 7 of the tutorial (visualize your score) by submitting a pull request to [this repo](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/tree/master/Models%20and%20Representations/Push%20Assignments%20Here) in the same subdirectory as Assignment 1.
