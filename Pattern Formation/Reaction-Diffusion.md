### Description of Turing Model

The Turing reaction-diffusion model [1], sometimes called _chemical morphogenesis_, is a mean field description in the form of balance equations. On the left hand size of the equation, we have to find the partial derivative of macrostates over time. The first part of the right-hand side of the equation shows the effect of a chemical reaction. The second part shows transport variables such as heat diffusivity ($D$) and macroscopic variables ($x_1, x_2,....x_i$) as they operate along a gradient ($\nabla$). 

$${\frac{\partial{x_i}}{\partial_t}} = V_i({x_j}, \lambda) + D_i \nabla^2 {x_i}\tag{1}$$

The coupled feedback system described in equations 2 and 3 are a restatement of the dynamics described in equation 1. Equation 2 characterizes the changes in $I$ per unit time (see Figure 1). $G(A, I)$ represents the reaction component, while $D_I$ represents the diffusion component. 

$${\frac{\partial{I}}{\partial{t}}} = G(A, I) + D_I {\frac{\partial^2{I}}{\partial{x^2}}}\tag{2}$$

Equation 3 characterizes the changes in $A$ per unit time (see Figure 1). $F(A, I)$ represents the reaction component, while $D_A$ represents the diffusion component.

$${\frac{\partial{A}}{\partial{t}}} = F(A, I) + D_A {\frac{\partial^2{A}}{\partial{x^2}}}\tag{3}$$

The activity of the black hexagons (striped pattern) is characterized in Equation 2, and is representative of faster diffusion, while the activity of yellow hexagons is characterized in Equation 3, and is representative of slower diffusion.

This simple form of [bistability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistability) provides a mechanism for striping and spotting in an organism's phenotype.  

### Other Mechanisms

Is the Turing mechanism enough to produce a patterned phenotype? Are there other mechanisms related to cell movements [4, 5] or interactions between genotype and phenotype [6] that provide a similar or augmentative mechanism? If we use marine angelfish as an example, we can see that the Turing model might be too slow to account for pattern recognition [4]. Instead, cells might move rather than change their internal state [5].

To demonstrate the role of cell movement and other phenotypic mechanisms for pattern formation, please download the NetLogo module for [Hex Cell Aggregation](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/HexCellAggregation). Run the simulation for various parameter values, then provide some feedback on which model (reaction-diffusion vs. movement) you think is more plausible.
